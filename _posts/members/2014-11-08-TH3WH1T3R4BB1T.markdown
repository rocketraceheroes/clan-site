#### Play Style
Strategist, Distraction, Meat Shield. The Great Communicator

#### Quote
“Because this is a very big idea my friends. We're talking about a non-exclusive egalitarian brotherhood where community status and more importantly age have no bearing whatsoever.” &mdash; Bernard 'Beanie' Campbell (Old School)

#### About
Bringing the West Coast style to RRH since 2004. I started console gaming on Intellivision in '79. Winning isn't everything, as long as we are having fun as a group. On the other hand, winning is my business and business is GOOD!
