#### About
Originally a Nintendo gamer, I made the switch to Xbox with Halo and have never looked back. Participated in several gaming forums and clans over the years. As a newly married man with a busy career, I've dialed down the game time quite a bit. I joined Rocket Race Heroes in 2014 thanks to my co-workers Tufo and Queuebit. Oh and I'm the webmaster of this fine establishment that you are looking at right meow.
