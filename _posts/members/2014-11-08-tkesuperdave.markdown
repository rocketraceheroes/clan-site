#### About
I'm what I like to call a social gamer, I enjoy playing games with other individuals instead of myself. I've been playing with friends ever since my parents bought me an Atari 2600 in the early 1990s. I joined RRH shortly after it was formed by way of a former member that I knew from a now defunct gaming group and have been one of it's longest active members along with Furry Chief and Tufo.
