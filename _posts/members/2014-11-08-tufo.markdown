#### Play Style
Humorist. Team player. Strategy over aggression. Callouts. Assists. The greater good.

#### Quote
"Sometimes you have to watch somebody love something before you can love it yourself. It is as if they are showing you the way." &mdash; Donald Miller, Blue Like Jazz

#### About
 Iâ€™ve been an avid gamer since I could hold a controller; I love building community. As a founding member of the Rocket Race Heroes, I have enjoyed gaming with the group for 15 years, through many stages of life: college, grad school, parenthood, and a career.
