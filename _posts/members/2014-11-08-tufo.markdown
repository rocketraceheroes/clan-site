#### Play Style
Team vehicle specialist. Role player. Callouts. Assists. The greater good.

"The universe is big; its vast and complicated and ridiculous, and sometimes, very rarely, impossible things just happen, and we call them miracles." &mdash; The Doctor

#### About
I've been an avid gamer since I could hold a controller and a fanatic of the Halo franchise since it's inception. As a founding member of the Rocket Race Heroes, I have enjoyed gaming with the group for a decade, through many stages of life: college, grad school, parenthood, and a career.
