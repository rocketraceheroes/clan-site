#### Play Style
Strategist and objective focused player. I have a love for breaking down a game or scenario to find the optimal course of action for myself or my team.

#### Quote
"It had to be me. Someone else might have gotten it wrong." &mdash; Mordin, Mass Effect 3

#### About
Husband, father, gamer. Rekindled my younger self's love for gaming a few years post-college after joining Rocket Race Heroes during the Halo 3 era, and now I love all things gaming. Artsy indie game, epic story-driven RPG, competitive shooter... whatever it is, give it to me now.
