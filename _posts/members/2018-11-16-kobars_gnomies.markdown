#### About
I've been a gamer since I was big enough to pick up a controller. I grew up playing the original Super Mario games on my parents' NES, and I got hooked on Halo when I discovered my friends and I could play together. Single player games like Halo, Oblivion, Mass Effect, and Fallout filled the majority of my gaming career up until I joined RRH at the beginning of 2018, but recently I've spent the limited hours I have to play shooting it up in PUBG with Chaedough and NightSurge.
