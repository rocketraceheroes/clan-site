####About
Casual gamer from the Nintendo days until World of Warcraft. I was in an active raid team and eventual Arena team before moving to competitive Magic: The Gathering. A few qualifiers and multiple control decks later I put the cards away anticipating a son. Moved to Hearthstone where I reached Legend rank. Destiny came and brought me back to console gaming and FPS in general. Punching the darkness away one dreg at a time.
