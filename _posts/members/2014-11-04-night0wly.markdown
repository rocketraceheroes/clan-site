####Play Style
I'm very good at killing things with a hammer! Other than that, I kill stuff when I can, however I can.

####About
I started gaming when I was young: running and jumping as a wee little Mario. Halo 3 is when my real obsession started; I love me some MC! I've worked in the Community Management/Public Relations field for many different Halo communities since then. Playing competitive Grifball has always been a highlight of my gaming time. I love smashing faces in with my hammer! Now with Destiny, I've joined the Rocket Race Heroes, a great group of people and I've never enjoyed gaming more! Bring on the good memories!
