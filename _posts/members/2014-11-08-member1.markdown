####ABOUT
I've been an avid gamer since I could hold a controller and a fanatic of the Halo franchise since it's inception. As a founding member of the Rocket Race Heroes, I have enjoyed gaming with the group for a decade, through many stages of life - college, grad school, parenthood, and a career.
