#### Play Style
Used to be more support-based, now I play pretty aggressive while maintaining as much agility as possible. Canâ€™t stand tanking. Knowing your enemy wins battles.

#### Quote
The best gunfights happen on the frontier!

#### About
Game Gear is totally underrated and Tails' Adventure was the best. SNES was my last console before Xbox. Now Destiny is my drug.
