####About
I began my gaming career with Mario and Punchout on the NES, though, to me, nothing has ever topped Halo. I balance work and family life with my gaming, but I'm proud that I have 25,000+ Halo multiplayer matches played. As a founding member back in 2004, our LAN parties became what we now know as the Rocket Race Heroes.
