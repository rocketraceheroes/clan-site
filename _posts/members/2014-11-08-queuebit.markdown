#### Quote
"Never really got into video games b/c if I want to waste hours on an addictive, useless, isolating pastime, heroin was invented in like 1875" &mdash; [Ken Jennings](https://twitter.com/KenJennings/status/259025336958861312)

#### About
I played Halo, stopped playing Halo, played some more Halo, and might play some Halo in the future.
